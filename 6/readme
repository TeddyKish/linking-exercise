Compile using 'g++ -Wall main.cpp ext.cpp'.

1. There are 2 TUs that include the "human.h" header, which implements the Human class.
   Why doesn't the compiler complain about multiple definitions?

2. Build using 'g++ -Wall main_alien.cpp ext_alien.cpp'. What happens?

3. How can you solve this problem?

4. Bonus: Template functions can be instantiated with the same type in different TUs.
   This essentially creates multiple definitions of the same function.
   Why doesn't that violate the ODR?
