So in this scenario, we attempt to create a global variable in C!
The global variable is in "helper.h". We included that file in different translation units.

Now, running 'gcc -Wall main.c' works perfectly fine.
However, trying to build using 'gcc -Wall main.c ext.c' fails! I wonder why..

1. What is the error?

2. What causes it?

3. Suggest 2 ways of solving the situation: thus being able to use a global variable across TUs.

**Note: In this scenario, you must modify the code, but not the build invocation command!

Bonus: Why does invoking 'g++ -Wall main.c ext.c' work on the original input?
