1. What type of error is it? What does it mean?

Undefined reference to 'yum'. 
This means the linker hasn't found an implementation of the identifier 'yum'.

2. What is the problem in this scenario?

The 'yum' identifer has been used in the 'main.c' translation unit, although the linker wasn't given an object file that contains an implementation for 'yum'.

3. How do you solve it? (Include the correct build command in your answer)

The solution includes providing the implementation for the external identifier 'yum' to the linker. This consists of adding the translation unit 'ext.c', where 'yum' was implemented, to the build process.

Compile using gcc -Wall main.c ext.c
