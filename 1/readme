Welcome to the first scenario!

The goal in this section is to produce an executable that prints "Yum's value is 10".
Apparently, executing a build using `gcc -Wall main.c` produces an error. I wonder why...

1. What type of error is it? What does it mean?

2. What is the problem in this scenario?

3. How do you solve it? (Include the correct build command in your answer)


**Note: You mustn't modify the code in this scenario!
