Hello!
In this exercise, main.c tries to import functions from ext.c

Compiling and running in its current form will work (when line 10 is commented out).
Use 'gcc -Wall main.c ext.c'.

1. Explain, to the maximal depth you can, how main.c uses 'func()' which is defined in ext.c.

2. Uncomment line 10. What error do you receive? Why does it happen?

3. How would you solve it?
