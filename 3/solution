1. Explain, to the maximal depth you can, how main.c uses 'func()' which is defined in ext.c.
- main.c requests 'void func()' in its import table.
  The linker searches for a single implementation of it.
  That definition is located in ext.obj, then it is linked in the final executable.

2. Uncomment line 10. What error do you receive? Why does it happen?
-  Undefined reference to 'enlarge(int)'. 
   This occurs because enlarge isn't exported from ext.c, but main.c tries to import it.

3. How would you solve it?
-  Remove the 'static' keyword
OR
-  Create a non-static proxy function that uses enlarge, and call the proxy function.
