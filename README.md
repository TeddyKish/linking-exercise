## linking-exercise
A bunch of linking exercises intended to teach practical applications of linking in C/C++.

# Scenario 1
Not building the entire codebase will trigger unresolved symbols.

# Scenario 2
Multiple declarations are ok, but multiple definitions are not.

# Scenario 3
The 'static' keyword on variables and functions.

# Scenario 4
Using a C style global variable between TUs.

# Scenario 5
Global variables using namespaces in C++.

# Scenario 6
Using inline to our advantage.

# Scenario 7
Theoretical exercise about weak symbols.
