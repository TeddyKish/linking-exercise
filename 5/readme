Previously, we learned about the usage of global variables in C.
To solve naming collisions and provide logical separations between identifiers, C++ introduces namespaces!

This code exmaple tries to use global variables in namespaces. For some reason it won't compile! I'm helpless..

-Prerequisite: Read about C++ namespaces.

1. What error occurs when trying to link main.o and ext.o?

2. How can this be solved using 'static'?

3. How can this be solved using 'extern'?

**Note: From this exercise onwards, use 'g++' instead of 'gcc'!
